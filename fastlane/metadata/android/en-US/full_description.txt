<p>Mavinote lets you create and edit notes.
It also lets you structure your notes by placing them in folders.</p>

<p>You can create a <b>Mavinote</b> account to synchronize your notes
across your devices.
Even after adding Mavinote account, you can still create folders and notes
that reside only in your device by creating them in <b>Local</b> account.
Anything created in Local account will not be available outside the device.
Local account will be automatically created when you launch the application
for the first time.</p>

<p>For more information about Mavinote,
you can look at the project's repository.</p>
